# Hyperscaler Account Pool

To provision clusters through Gardener using Kyma Infrastructure Manager, Kyma Environment Broker (KEB) requires a hyperscaler (GCP, Azure, AWS, etc.) account/subscription. Managing the available hyperscaler accounts is not in the scope of KEB. Instead, the available accounts are handled by Hyperscaler Account Pool (HAP).

HAP stores credentials for the hyperscaler accounts that have been set up in advance in Kubernetes Secrets. The credentials are stored separately for each provider and tenant. The content of the credentials Secrets may vary for different use cases. The Secrets are labeled with the **hyperscalerType** and **tenantName** labels to manage pools of credentials for use by the provisioning process. This way, the in-use credentials and unassigned credentials available for use are tracked. Only the **hyperscalerType** label is added during Secret creation, and the **tenantName** label is added when the account respective for a given Secret is claimed. The content of the Secrets is opaque to HAP.

The Secrets are stored in a Gardener seed cluster pointed to by HAP. They are available within a given Gardener project specified in the KEB and Kyma Infrastructure Manager configuration. This configuration uses a `kubeconfig` that gives KEB and Kyma Infrastructure Manager access to a specific Gardener seed cluster, which, in turn, enables access to those Secrets.

This diagram shows the HAP workflow:

Before a new cluster is provisioned, KEB queries for a Secret based on the **tenantName** and **hyperscalerType** labels.
If a Secret is found, KEB uses the credentials stored in this Secret. If a matching Secret is not found, KEB queries again for an unassigned Secret for a given hyperscaler and adds the **tenantName** label to claim the account and use the credentials for provisioning.

One tenant can use only one account per given hyperscaler type.

This is an example of a Kubernetes Secret that stores hyperscaler credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {SECRET_NAME}
  labels:
    # tenantName is omitted for new, not yet claimed account credentials
    tenantName: {TENANT_NAME}
    hyperscalerType: {HYPERSCALER_TYPE}
```

## Shared Credentials

For a certain type of SAP BTP, Kyma runtimes, KEB can use the same credentials for multiple tenants.
In such a case, the Secret with credentials must be labeled differently by adding the **shared** label set to `true`. Shared credentials will not be assigned to any tenant.
Multiple tenants can share the Secret with credentials. That is, many shoots (Shoot resources) can refer to the same Secret. This reference is represented by the SecretBinding resource.
When KEB queries for a Secret for the given hyperscaler, the least used Secret is chosen.  

This is an example of a Kubernetes Secret that stores shared credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {SECRET_NAME}
  labels:
    hyperscalerType: {HYPERSCALER_TYPE}
    shared: "true"
```

### Shared Credentials for `sap-converged-cloud` Plan

For the `sap-converged-cloud` plan, each region is treated as a separate hyperscaler. Hence, Secrets are labeled with **openstack_{region name}**, for example, **openstack_eu-de-1**.

## EU Access

The [EU access](03-20-eu-access.md) regions need a separate credentials pool. The Secret contains the additional label **euAccess** set to `true`. This is an example of a Secret that stores EU access hyperscaler credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {SECRET_NAME}
  labels:
    # tenantName is omitted for new, not yet claimed account credentials
    tenantName: {TENANT_NAME}
    hyperscalerType: {HYPERSCALER_TYPE}
    euAccess: "true"
```

## Assured Workloads

SAP BTP, Kyma runtime supports the BTP cf-sa30 GCP subaccount region. This region uses the Assured Workloads Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) control package. Kyma Control Plane manages cf-sa30 Kyma runtimes in a separate
Google Cloud hyperscaler account pool. The Secret contains the label **hyperscalerType** set to `gcp_cf-sa30`. The following is an example of a Secret that uses the Assured Workloads KSA control package:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {SECRET_NAME}
  labels:
    # tenantName is omitted for new, not yet claimed account credentials
    tenantName: {TENANT_NAME}
    hyperscalerType: "gcp_cf-sa30"
```
