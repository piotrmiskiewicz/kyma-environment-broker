# Plan Configuration

According to the Open Service Broker API (OSB API) specification, KEB supports Kyma's multiple plans. Each plan has its own configuration, which specifies allowed regions, zones, machine type and its display names. This document describes an overview of plans configuration. You can find more details in the following documents:
* [Regions Configuration](03-60-regions-configuration.md)
* [Machine Types Configuration](03-70-machines-configuration.md)
* [Regions Supporting Machine Types](03-50-regions-supporting-machine.md)
* [Kyma Template Configuration](03-90-kyma-template-configuration.md)
* [Plan Updates](03-80-plan-updates.md)
* [Hyperscaler Account Pool Rules](03-11-hap-rules.md)
* [Bindings](../user/05-60-kyma-bindings.md)

## Enabling plan

The `enablePlans` contains a comma separated supported plan names. To enable plan add the name to the comma separated list of plans, for example:
```yaml
enablePlans: "trial,aws,gcp"
```

## HAP Rules

Each Kyma needs a subscription for the hyperscaler. The HAP Rule configuration allows you to define how the subsription is selected, for example:

```yaml
hap:
  rule:
    - aws(PR=cf-eu11) -> EU
    - aws
```

Every plan must have at least one HAP rule defined.

## Configure Plan Details

Every plan has its own configuration which allows you to specify a details of a plan, for example:

```yaml
plansConfiguration:
  
  # one or more plans can be defined
  aws,build-runtime-aws:
    
      # defines allowed plan changes
      upgradableToPlans:
        - build-runtime-aws
      
      # volume size in GB
      volumeSizeGb: 80
      
      # defines a list of machine types
      regularMachines:
        - "m6i.large"
        - "m6i.xlarge"
      
      # defines additional machines, which can be used only in additional worker node pools
      additionalMachines:
        - "c7i.large"
        - "c7i.xlarge"
      
      # defines a list of regions where the plan can be used grouped by BTP region
      regions:
        cf-eu11:
          - "eu-central-1"
        default:
          - "eu-central-1"
          - "eu-west-2"
  
```

## Configure Provider Details

Each provider has its own configuration which defines provider details, for example:

```yaml
providersConfiguration:
  aws:
    # machine display names
    machines:
      "m6i.large": "m6i.large (2vCPU, 8GB RAM)"
      "m6i.xlarge": "m6i.xlarge (4vCPU, 16GB RAM)"
      
    # machine type families that are not universally available across all regions
    regionsSupportingMachine:
      g6:
        eu-central-1: [a, b]
        
    # region display names and zones
    regions:
      eu-central-1:
          displayName: "eu-central-1 (Europe, Frankfurt)"
          zones: ["a", "b", "c"]
      eu-west-2:
          displayName: "eu-west-2 (Europe, London)"
          zones: ["a", "b", "c"]
```

## Bindings

Bindings allows generating credentials for accessing the cluster. To enable bindigns for a given plan, you must add a plan name to the `bindablePlans` list in the `broker.binding` section of the configuration. For example, to enable bindings for the `aws` plan, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml
broker:
  binding:
    bindablePlans: aws
```
> [!NOTE]
> Bindings are not required to create a Kyma.

## Kyma Custom Resource Template Configuration

Kyma Environment Broker (KEB) uses the Kyma custom resource template to create a Kyma CR. If you want to define a custom Kyma CR template, define `runtimeConfiguration` setting according to [Kyma Template Configuration](03-90-kyma-template-configuration.md), for example:

````yaml
runtimeConfiguration: |-
  default: |-
    kyma-template: |-
      apiVersion: operator.kyma-project.io/v1beta2
      kind: Kyma
      metadata:
        labels:
          "operator.kyma-project.io/managed-by": "lifecycle-manager"
        name: tbd
        namespace: kcp-system
      spec:
        channel: regular
        modules: []
````
